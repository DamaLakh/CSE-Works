In recent microprocessors or ASIC chips, the operating frequency is set by the target market.This leads to very tight timing and power constraints for the proposed circuit design. The industrial shift  for adopting lower technology nodes also presents a new challenging frontier as transistors get less efficient as they undergo scaling. Analog designers are expected to optimize  these conventional designs and yet meet the reduced power constraints and performance metrics imposed by various applications.
