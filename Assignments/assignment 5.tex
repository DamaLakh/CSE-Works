\textbf{Q.1} We have been given two urns; Urn 1 contains 3 Blue and 3 Black balls, Urn 2 contains 2 blue and 15 black balls. One ball is drawn and kept aside, then another ball is drawn. Find the probability that the second ball drawn is blue.

\textbf{Q.2} A bag contains 8 white and 6 red balls.
What is the probability of drawing 2 balls of same color?

\textbf{Q.3} Box $A$ contains 2 white and 4 blue balls; Box $B$ contains 5 white and 7 blue balls.
A ball is transferred from box $A$ to $B$, then a ball is drawn from $B$. What is the probability that the drawn ball is white?
