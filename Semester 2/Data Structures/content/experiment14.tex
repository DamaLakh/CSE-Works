\section{Depth First Search}
\label{sec:Depth First Search}

\subsection{Objective}
Write a program for Depth first search.

\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mystyle]
For the DFS implementation we'll put each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:
    1. Not Visited
    2. Visited
Now we'll mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.
The algorithm will go as follows:
    Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
    Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
    Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
    Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Code}

\subsection{Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=output]
Adjacency list of vertex 0
2 -> 1 -> 

Adjacency list of vertex 1
2 -> 0 -> 

Adjacency list of vertex 2
3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 

Adjacency list of vertex 3
2 -> 

Visited 2 
Visited 3 
Visited 1 
Visited 0 
\end{lstlisting}
